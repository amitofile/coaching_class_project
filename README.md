Deliverables :

2. Please host your APIs on some cloud hosting servers.

Note:
1. In the case of ExpressJS, use middleware for authentication. In the case of NestJS, use guards.
2. We expect you to complete the assignment in 2 days.
3. If you use Postman, send us the export of the APIs collection.
4. The quality of code and use of reusable functions matter.
5. Commit your code on GitHub and share it with us. Please do not send code as zip.
6. APIs are all that we need, we are not concerned about UI. However, if you want to give UI, that is an added advantage for us to test quickly.
